# crackWaste - An App to track the waste that is being collection.
## This app was made as part of the MakeUC 2020 Hackathon conducted by MajorLeagueHacking(MLH season2021) with a team of 4 members.
### This is the Front-End part of the application that we made.

### The motive behind this app is simple - "Leave no waste behind". This is done by having the garbage collector scan the QRCode with the house owner.On scannning this, all the details of the house owner is sent to a database. This way the waste output of each house can easily be tracked thus encouraging people to not throw trash on the roadside because of missed trash collection.
